Key words: Gene expression evolution, complex traits, early burst, key innovation, snake venom.


##Background:
Key innovations are traits responsible for evolutionary ‘success’ of a taxa. These traits provide ecological opportunities that in turn promotes lineage diversification. By definition, the origin of key innovations leads to greater phenotypic disparity between clades, and an eventual slowdown in evolutionary rates as ecological niches get filled. This ‘early burst’ pattern is rare in comparative data, perhaps because most studies focus on phenotypic change while ignoring gene expression variation that underpins it. We test for patterns of early burst in venom gene expression data from 52 venomous snake species. Venoms evolve rapidly and are essential for prey capture, and as a result, they are widely believed to be key innovations. However, until now no quantitative analysis tested this widely held assumption. 

##Results:
By using estimates of phenotypic disparity and evolutionary rate dynamics, we show that in general, expression levels in snake venom toxins do not exhibit an early burst pattern. The majority of toxins show high within clade disparity for most of their history, and rather than showing a decrease in evolutionary rates of expression, most toxins actually show an increase. Some highly-expressed toxin families, which were likely recruited earlier in the evolutionary history of venomous snakes, show greater between clade disparity and have experienced an eventual slowdown in evolutionary rates in extant snakes. While some toxins families show occasional periods of greater disparity than expected under a null model, we find no significant evidence of early burst. 

##Conclusions:
Despite its importance, innovation in venom chemistry lacks clear mechanisms that would lead to reproductive isolation and subsequent diversification. Key innovations are an important source of ecological opportunity; however, they cannot cause lineage diversification on their own.  If the relative impacts of new habitat, antagonistic extinction, and early stage allopatry are sufficiently strong, release from natural selection and subsequent adaptive radiation might still take place. Therefore, the diversification of venom systems likely acts in concert with other ecological factors to promote speciation, if at all.
